            <title>Requirements</title>
            <para>pluginbox is being developed on Linux and OSX systems, and
                should be fairly easy to export to other Unix-like systems. However,
                we don't yet support other platforms, due to lack of time, although
                it should be working without major problems on Windows (through
                Cygwin), Mac OSX, Solaris and FreeBSD. </para>

        <title>Installing pluginbox</title>
        <para>This chapter explains how to build and install pluginbox from
            source or from a binary package. The goal of this chapter is to get
            the module compiled and all the files in the correct places; the next
            chapter will explain how to configure it.</para>

                either the latest release version or the daily snapshot of the
                development source tree for the next release version, depending on
                whether you want to use Pluginbox for production use or to participate
                in the development.

                is not supposed to be very important, nor contain much information.

            <title>Compiling pluginbox</title>
            <para>
                If you are using Pluginbox on a supported platform, or one that is
                similar enough to one, compiling Pluginbox should be trivial. After you
                have unpacked the source package of your choose, or after you have
                checked out the source code from CVS, enter the following commands:
                <screen>
                    <userinput> ./bootstrap ./configure make </userinput>
                </screen>
                The
                <filename>bootstrap</filename>
                script uses autoconf to generate the files needed to build the
                module. The
                <filename>configure</filename>
                script investigates various things on your computer for the Pluginbox
                compilation needs, and writes out the
                <filename>Makefile</filename>
                used to compile the module.
                <command>make</command>
                then runs the commands to actually compile it.
            </para>
            <para>
                If either command writes out an error message and stops before it
                finishes its job, you have a problem, and you either need to fix it
                yourself, if you can, or report the problem to the Kannel project.
                See
                <xref linkend="bug-reporting"/> for details.
            </para>
            <para>
                For detailed instruction on using the configuration script, see file
                <filename>INSTALL</filename>
                . That file is a generic documentation for
                <command>configure</command>
                . Pluginbox defines a few additional options:
                <itemizedlist>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>

                            <replaceable>DIR</replaceable>
                            Where to look for Kannel Gateway libs and header files
                            <replaceable>DIR</replaceable>
                            points to the Kannel installation directory. Defaults to
                            <literal>/usr/local</literal>
                        </para>
                    </listitem>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>
                            <literal>--disable-docs (default is --enable-docs)</literal>
                            Use this option if you don't have DocBook installed and/or you
                            want to save some time and CPU cycles. Pre-generated
                            documentation is available on Kannel's site. Default behavior is
                            to build documentation, b.e., converting the User Guide from the
                            DocBook markup language to PostScript and HTML if DocBook is
                            available.
                        </para>

                    <listitem>
                        <para>
                            <literal>--enable-drafts (default is
                                --disable-drafts)</literal>
                            When building documentation, include the sections marked as
                            <literal>draft</literal>
                            .

            </para>
            <para>
                You may need to add compilations flags to configure:
                <screen>
                    <userinput>CFLAGS='-pthread' ./configure</userinput>
                </screen>
                The above, for instance, seems to be required on FreeBSD. If you
                want to develop Pluginbox, you probably want to add CFLAGS that make
                your compiler use warning messages. For example, for GCC:
                <screen>
                    <userinput>CFLAGS='-Wall -O2 -g' ./configure</userinput>
                </screen>
                (You may, at your preference, use even stricter checking options.)

            <title>Installing Pluginbox</title>
            <para>
                After you have compiled Kannel, you need to install the pluginbox binary
                in a suitable place. This is most easily done by using
                <command>make</command> again:
                <screen>
                    <userinput>make bindir=<replaceable>/path/to/directory</replaceable> install</userinput>
                </screen>
                Replace
                <replaceable>/path/to/directory</replaceable>
                with the pathname of the actual directory where the programs should
                be installed. This install the pluginbox binary:

        <title>Using pluginbox</title>
        <para>This chapter explains how to configure and run Pluginbox and also
          how to tell if it's running from Kannel's HTTP interface.</para>
        <para>There is only one configuration file for Pluginbox, and that file
          commands all aspects of its execution.</para>
        <sect1>
            <title>Configuring Pluginbox</title>
            <para>The configuration file can be divided into two parts:
                pluginbox configuration and database connection.</para>
            <para>Details of each part are in appropriate sections later on
                this documentation.</para>
            <sect2>
                <title>Configuration file syntax</title>
                <para>The syntax used for the configuration file is the same used
                  in Kannel. Skip this section if you are already familiar with it.
                  Otherwise, keep on reading:</para>
                <para>
                    A configuration file consists of groups of configuration variables.
                    Groups are separated by empty lines, and each variable is defined
                    on its own line. Each group in Pluginbox configuration is
                    distinguished with a group variable. Comments are lines that begin
                    with a number sign (
                    <literal>#</literal>
                    ) and are ignored (they don't, for example, separate groups of
                    variables).
                </para>
                <para>
                    A variable definition line has the name of the variable, and equals
                    sign (
                    <literal>=</literal>
                    ) and the value of the variable. The name of the variable can
                    contain any characters except whitespace and equals. The value of
                    the variable is a string, with or without quotation marks (
                    <literal></literal>
                    ) around it. Quotation marks are needed if the variable needs to
                    begin or end with whitespace or contain special characters. Normal

                    to include other file or a directory with files to the

                <para>This allows to segment the specific configuration groups

                <para>
                    Here is an example that illustrates the
                    <literal>include </literal>

<programlisting>

                    statement may be defined at any point in the configuration file and
                    at any inclusion depth. Hence you can cascade numerous inclusions

                    always include an 'pluginbox' group for general configuration. This

                <para>

group = pluginbox
bearerbox-port = 13001
smsbox-port = 13005
</programlisting>
                    Naturally this is usually not sufficient for any real use. Thus, one or

    <para>You need to start <literal>pluginbox</literal> after starting

<title>Starting the box</title>

  <para>If you want to start it from command line (for testing, for

    <screen><userinput>
    /path/to/pluginbox -v 1 [config-file]
    </userinput></screen>

  The <option>-v 1</option> sets the logging level to
  <literal>INFO</literal>. This way, you won't see a large amount of
  debugging output (the default is <literal>DEBUG</literal>). Full
  explanation of Pluginbox command line arguments is below.</para>

  <para><emphasis>[config-file]</emphasis> is the name of the
  configuration file you are using with Pluginbox. The basic distribution
  packet comes with a sample configuration file you can use with some
  minor tweakings (check on the <literal>/examples</literal> folder.
  Feel free to edit the file to suit your needs.</para>

  <para>Of course you need to have the <literal>bearerbox</literal> running
  before starting the box. Without the bearer box, pluginbox won't even start.</para>
